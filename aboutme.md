title: About me
---

My name is Antony, and I am a Computer Network Engineer graduate and a self taught information security enthusiast. I'm particularly interested in web application hacking and Bug bounties. I created this blog to share my journey in the cybersecurity community.

I'm addicted to combat sports and a highly active association member of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

I'm currently in search of a Pentester job opportunity. You can [*email me*](mailto:gmigan.a @gmail.com) or find me on [*Linkedin*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antony-gandonou-migan/) if you want to get in touch.
