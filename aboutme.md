title: About me
---

My name is Antony, and I am a Computer Network Engineer graduate and a self taught information security enthusiast. I'm particularly interested in web application hacking and Bug bounties. I created this blog to share my journey in the cybersecurity community.

I'm addicted to combat sports and a highly active association member of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

I'm currently in search of a Pentester job opportunity. You can get more information [there](http://www.antonygandonou.eu/resume/).
